Hey there! I'm Chris Lumibao, just starting out my journey as a freshman at the University of California, Riverside. Super stoked to dive into the whole college experience! Right now, I'm dipping my toes into the world of pre-business, exploring the ins and outs of the business scene.
But hey, life isn't just about textbooks and lectures, right? Outside the classroom, you'll often find me glued to my gaming console. I'm a bit of a video game enthusiast â€“ it's my way of unwinding and maybe flexing some strategic thinking muscles.
Sports are also my jam! I'm all about hitting the volleyball court and shooting hoops on the basketball court. It's not just about staying fit; there's something about the teamwork, discipline, and those crazy buzzer-beater moments that I absolutely love.
Looking ahead, I've got my eyes on snagging an internship for the upcoming summer. Real-world experience, here I come! I want to bridge that gap between theory and practice, you know? And yeah, the ultimate goal? Landing a cool job after rocking the cap and gown.
The whole college thing can be a wild ride, but I'm embracing every bit of it. UC Riverside is my playground for growth, both academically and personally. 
<br><br>

        Shoutout to the awesome courses and opportunities that are shaping me into a more rounded person.
So, this isn't just about getting a degree. It's about soaking up every experience, making mistakes, and figuring out who I am in the process. Can't wait to see where this adventure takes me! Music is like the heartbeat of my life â€“ it fills me with pure joy and inspiration. One thing that really gets my spirits soaring is attending raves. The thumping beats, the lively atmosphere, and the shared energy of the crowd make it an experience that's just so invigorating and liberating. When I'm lost in the rhythm, it's like a temporary escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life.
But as much as I love the music scene, my heart is equally devoted to my family. They're the rock that grounds me, and spending quality time with them is my top priority. Whether it's sitting down for a meal, having heart-to-heart talks, or going on little adventures together, those moments with family are truly priceless.<br><br>
 
        It's where I find my sense of belonging and the support that makes me feel truly connected.
And then there are my friends â€“ my chosen family. The laughter, shared interests, and mutual understanding that we have make every moment spent together memorable. It's the diversity of experiences from these relationships that adds color and depth to my life.
Balancing fun and productivity is my kind of juggling act. Sure, I love the thrill of raving and the warmth of family and friends, but I also get a kick out of being productive. It's about making the most of my time, whether I'm chasing personal dreams or professional goals. I believe in living life to the fullest, in a way that's both enjoyable and meaningful.
Going to raves and losing myself in the music is my way of recharging. It's like hitting the refresh button on my soul, giving me the energy I need to face whatever life throws at me. But at the same time, I've got this burning desire to achieve my ambitions and make a positive impact in the world.
